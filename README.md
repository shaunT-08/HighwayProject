# PCBProject - Temperature Sensor
My Repository which contains the gerber and drill files for my hardware PCB project

Backstory on the project:

I am a rising senior who just figured out that I want to pursue Electrical Engineering in college, and I thought it would be good to dip my toes in with this really basic project, just to figure out how it works. Hopefully this will be the first of many projects, and I hope to shoot higher and higher with each subsequent project. Wish me luck on my journey.

Project description:
This is a simple temperature sensor which can scan the surrounding temperature and if the temperature is greater than 50 degrees Fahrenheit, the Red LED will be on, and if it is below 50 degrees Fahrentheit, the Green LED will be on. There is also a push button to turn the sensor on, and the Arduino Nano ESP32 will be used to determine circuit logic.

BOM:

1x Arduino Nano ESP32 | 
1x SHT1x Temperature Sensor | 
2x 220 Ohm Resistors | 
1x Push Button |
